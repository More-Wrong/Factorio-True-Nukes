[item-description]
big-atomic-artillery-shell=15kt yield, roughly equivalent to the Little Boy. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 200m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 1000m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 3km radius. This weapon is so devastating, it may crash the game, it has no practical use, and is merely here for demonstrative purposes.
atomic-artillery-shell=1kt yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 80m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 500m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 1km radius. Use with extreme caution.
atomic-bomb=20t yield, roughly equivilent to the Davy Crockett. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 20m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for 150m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 300m radius. Use with caution.
atomic-cannon-shell=2t yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 2m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for 50m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 100m radius. Can be fired from the tank with minimal damage, although a nearby hit can instantly vaporize both the tank, and the player.

[technology-description]
atomic-artillery-shells=With the larger space in an artillery shell, these weapons have much higher yields, capable of destroying huge areas at once, and their long range helps the firing position survive.
atomic-bomb=These devastating weapons have relatively low yields, but can still destroy almost anything.
